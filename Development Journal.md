Commit 1: Adds a readme
Commit 2:The first commit was spent installing Next.js,tailwind.css and other packages. I then installed a zip containing customized versions of layout.tsx,lib and other folders to speed up development time by having color variables,fonts and other sizes set for me rather than preparing it manually. 
Error(Semantic): When running the app instead of the homepage appearing, A generic next.js page is displayed
Commit 3: delete page.tsx from app so routing works
Commit 4: Added a Chart and fixed a div issue, learning that some components may be considered <p> or potentially other tags that cause conflict with code
Commit 5: Added Ui enhancements to the total banks chart
